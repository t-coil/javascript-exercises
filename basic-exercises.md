# Ten Simple Javascript Exercises

1. Define a function max() that takes two numbers as arguments and returns the largest of them. Hint: you may want to use conditionals.

2. Define a function maxOfThree() that takes three numbers as arguments and returns the largest of them.

3. Write a function that takes a character (i.e. a string of length 1) and returns true if it is a vowel, false otherwise.

4. Write a function translate() that will translate a text into "rövarsprĺket". That is, double every consonant and place an occurrence of "o" in between. For example, translate("this is fun") should return the string "tothohisos isos fofunon".

5. Define a function sum() and a function multiply() that sums and multiplies (respectively) all the numbers in an array of numbers. For example, sum([1,2,3,4]) should return 10, and multiply([1,2,3,4]) should return 24.

6. Define a function reverse() that computes the reversal of a string. For example, reverse("jag testar") should return the string "ratset gaj".

7. Represent a small bilingual lexicon as a Javascript object in the following fashion {"merry":"god", "christmas":"jul", "and":"och", "happy":gott", "new":"nytt", "year":"ĺr"} and use it to translate your Christmas cards from English into Swedish.

8. Write a function findLongestWord() that takes an array of words and returns the length of the longest one.

9. Write a function filterLongWords() that takes an array of words and an integer i and returns the array of words that are longer than i.

10. Write a function charFreq() that takes a string and builds a frequency listing of the characters contained in it. Represent the frequency listing as a Javascript object. Try it with something like charFreq("abbabcbdbabdbdbabababcbcbab").
